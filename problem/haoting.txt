Detail analysis of song haoting (true bass, detected bass, miss reasons)

haoting misses with parameter set (with OF + MOM only)
(1     2     3     4     5     6    12    17    26    59    65)
1 T=G, B=C#, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak (try adaptive range)
2 T=C, B=A, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak
3 T=B, B=A, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak
4 T=A, B=D, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak
5 T=G, B=F#, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak quite well
6 T=F, B=G, the fix reduced spectrum doesn't cover the true peak quite well
12 T=A, B=C, minProm constrain filter out the peak at 219Hz (try implement the minProm yourself and add more flexibility)
17 T=A, B=C, minProm constrain filter out the peak at 219Hz
26 T=E, B=F, true peak doesn't get overtone sum, because the location of true peak too high
59 T=G#, B=D, true peak doesn't get overtone sum, because the location of true peak too high
65 T=A, B=D#, true peak doesn't get overtone sum, because the location of true peak too high
